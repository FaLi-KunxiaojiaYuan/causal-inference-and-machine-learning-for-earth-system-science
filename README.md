# causal inference and machine learning for earth system science
###
The repository contains exemplary studies and codes of using advanced causal inference and machine learning methods to solve critical earth system scientifical problems. In this study, we used causal inference method to capture the causal relationship between evaporative fraction (EF, indicator of surface energy partitioning patterns) and its related drivers. Furthermore, we built machine learning surrogate models to investigate and reduce CMIP6 model biases originated from parameters and diverse model structures.  
### Note  
Details of the research will be seen in the paper “Understanding and reducing the biases of land surface energy flux partitioning in CMIP6 land models” (The manuscript is ready to submit). If you have any questions of the code, please contact yuankunxiaojia@gmail.com or lifa.lbnl@gmail.com.
